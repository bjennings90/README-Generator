# README-Generator

## Description

Just having learned Node.js and how interesting I find how it works, I was very excited to start this challenge. I built this project to demonstrate how to create a README app using Node.js in the terminal. In creating this app, I learned how to create html and css in the terminal, how to structure and generate a README file.

## Installation

To install, clone my repository README-Generator, locally to your computer.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To use this app, add console logs to the .then(), writeToFile(), and writeFile() functions. Then type "node.js index.js" in the terminal to answer prompts. Once finished a readme file "Generated-Readme" will appear in the Explorer panel where you will see the completed read me file. To preview, simply right click the tab of "Generated-Readme" and select "Open Preview".
